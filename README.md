Although, this project was started and stopped many months ago it was finally put on GitHub on May 14th, 2022.

This data science project is based on data found at:

- [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports): collected for 2014-2021

The file directory structure generally follows a schema suggested in [Tidyverse For Data Science](https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/)
