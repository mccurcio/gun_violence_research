ARE there issues with the data you display on your website?
1. On `https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports`, There is NO reporting links for 2020 or 2021. Is this correct?
2. The link for `Mass Shootings - All Years`, On `https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports`, only shows data for 2018 on. Is that correct?
3. Exporting data from the "Last 72 hours" actually provides data from 2018 to 2022, not the last 72 hours. Actually it seem difficult to download ONLY data for 2022, Jan to May.
4. On `https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls` page the data in the blue box for 2021 is not consistent with the data from the previous years.
Please Advise,
Thank You,
