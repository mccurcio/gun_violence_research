There are 125 observations with 24 features.

Only six of the features are numeric or integer.     
1. fatalities    
2. injured    
3. total victims    
4. Latitude     
5. Longitude    
6. Year    

The remaining 18 are character vectors.   

```{r}
dim(Mother_Jones_Gun_Violence_DB)
```


### Let's carry out a six-number summary of the six numeric features

```{r}
mj_db_numeric <- Mother_Jones_Gun_Violence_DB[c(5,6,7)]

summary(mj_db_numeric)
```

- Of the three features, there is one outlier. This is the Las Vegas Shooting which had 58 fatalities, 546 people injured which is a total of 604 people. 

- If we consider the 'Deadliest Terror Attacks' table below for comparison. We find that the 58 fatalities from the Las Vegas shooting would be the tenth most fatal incident.
OR
- If we use the total victims we see that 604 victims would rank **fifth**.

```{r}
colSums(mj_db_numeric)
```
